Package: libcapnp-0.4.0
Architecture: any
Section: libs
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Cap'n Proto C++ library
 Similar to Protocol Buffers, Cap'n Proto is an efficient means of
 serializing structured data to be transferred across a network or
 written to disk. Users write a Cap'n Proto definition file that
 drives a code generator, which in turn emits C++ code for encoding &
 decoding messages in the Cap'n Proto format.
 .
 In addition to being extremely fast, Cap'n Proto also smooths over some
 of the rougher aspects of Protocol Buffers & introduces a number of new
 features to boot.
 .
 This package contains the runtime libraries needed for C++ applications.

 This package contains a small suite of tools for developing & maintaining
 your Cap'n Proto schema files, including a code generator for compiling
 your schema files to supported languages.
